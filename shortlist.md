Got it! A concise list of the core Git commands for notes.

Here's a simple number list summarizing the essential Git commands for managing your changes:

### Essential Git Commands Workflow

1.  **Stage Changes (Prepare for Commit):**
    * **Purpose:** To tell Git which specific changes or new files you want to include in your *next* commit.
    * **Specific:** To stage a particular file or folder:
        ```powershell
        git add path/to/your/file.txt
        git add path/to/your/folder/
        ```
    * **Overall:** To stage *all* new, modified, or deleted files in your current directory and its subdirectories:
        ```powershell
        git add .
        ```

2.  **Create New Items (Files/Folders):**
    * **Purpose:** To create new files or folders on your local system. These are standard PowerShell commands, not Git commands, but are part of the workflow.
    * **New File:**
        ```powershell
        New-Item YourFileName.txt -ItemType File
        ```
    * **New Folder:**
        ```powershell
        mkdir YourFolderName
        ```
    * **New Folder with Placeholder (for Git to track empty folders):**
        ```powershell
        mkdir YourFolderName; New-Item YourFolderName\.gitkeep -ItemType File
        ```

3.  **Commit Changes (Save a Snapshot):**
    * **Purpose:** To save the staged changes as a new, permanent version in your project's local history. Each commit has a unique ID and a message.
    * **Command:**
        ```powershell
        git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
        ```

4.  **Push Changes (Upload to GitHub/Remote):**
    * **Purpose:** To upload your local commits from your current branch to the connected remote repository (e.g., GitHub). This makes your changes available online and acts as a backup.
    * **First Push (to establish tracking):**
        ```powershell
        git push -u origin main
        ```
    * **Subsequent Pushes (after tracking is set up):**
        ```powershell
        git push
        ```
